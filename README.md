# SpendFlux ðŸ’¸

SpendFlux is a **personal finance management system** built with **Java 21 + Spring Boot 3**, designed as a **modular monolith** following **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**.  
This is **Phase 1** of the project: a clean, modular foundation that will naturally evolve into microservices in **Phase 2**.
